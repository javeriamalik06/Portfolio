## [Telecom Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction) <a name="telecom-customer-churn-prediction"></a>

I did this project for my 'Analytical Approach in Marketing Decisions' course during my undergraduate.

* Data was taken from Kaggle
* Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression and Decision Trees
* Logistic Regression was used to predict the churn and profitability
* Decision trees were used to identify customer segments and strategies to maximize satisfaction from each segment
* Code and Final report available
* Technology: **R** (caret, PRROC, rpart, rpart.plot)

## [Stock and Portfolio Analysis](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Stock-and-Portfolio-Analysis-and-Prediction) <a name="stock-and-portfolio-analysis"></a>

I did these projects for my 'Programming for Finance' course during my undergraduate.

### [Stock Analysis for Burshane Private Limited (BPL)](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Stock-and-Portfolio-Analysis-and-Prediction/tree/main/Project%201) <a name="stock-analysis-for-burshane-private-limited-bpl"></a>

* Real-life stock data used through Yahoo Finance library
* Programming language used: Python
* Important tech concepts used: Prophet (time series forecasting), RollingOLS (Rolling Regression), Backtesting
  1. Prophet is used for time series forecasting of stock prices
  2. RollingOLS is used to calculate beta in a rolling window for Cost of Capital calculation
  3. Backtesting is used to test strategies on historical data
* Code and Final report available
* Technology: **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, talib, prophet, backtesting, psx, numpy)

### [Portfolio Risk Analysis and Optimization for PKGS, PPP, BPL](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Stock-and-Portfolio-Analysis-and-Prediction/tree/main/Project%202) <a name="portfolio-risk-analysis-and-optimization-for-pkgs-ppp-bpl"></a>

* Important concepts used: Historical VaR, Model-Building VaR, Monte-Carlo VaR, Copulas
  1. Historical VaR is used for calculating Value at Risk using historical stock price data
  2. Model-Building VaR is used for calculating Value at Risk using the parametric approach and variance-covariance matrix
  3. Monte-Carlo VaR is used for calculating Value at Risk using simulations
  4. Copulas are used for modeling dependencies between different stocks in the portfolio
* Code and Final report available
* Technology: **Python** (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statsmodels, copulae, riskfolio, psx, yfinance)

## [Maven Movies Analysis-SQL](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Maven-Movies-Analysis-SQL) <a name="maven-movies-analysis-sql"></a>

* Implemented SQL queries with aggregate functions, CASE statements, JOIN operations, and UNION to extract and merge comprehensive relational database insights.
* Important Concepts Used: Exploratory Data Analysis of a movie database
  1. Basic SQL Operations: SELECT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
  2. Data Aggregation: Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX)
  3. Data Filtering and Sorting: HAVING, CASE statements
  4. Data Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, multi-condition joins
  5. Data Manipulation: UNION operations
* Technology: **SQL**
