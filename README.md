# Javeria Malik - Data Analysis/Science Portfolio

Hello! I am Javeria, a data analyst and aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in business. 

I am currently pursuing my Masters in Business Analytics at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign and I have a Bachelors in Business Administration from IBA Karachi. My work experience includes a year as a Quantitative Insights Consultant at Oula (Kantar) where I strengthened my skills in data-driven insights generation, quantitative analysis and data storytelling. 

The following portfolio showcases my skills, and you can find my CV [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PK9DWERGcIMHOM5xXtVKMuRL0g7MPrhFnfVe63ApAU4/edit?usp=sharing).

## [Telecom Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction) <a name="telecom-customer-churn-prediction"></a>

I did this project for my 'Analytical Approach in Marketing Decisions' course during my undergraduate.

* Data was taken from Kaggle
* Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression and Decision Trees
* Logistic Regression was used to predict the churn and profitability
* Decision trees were used to identify customer segments and strategies to maximize satisfaction from each segment
* [Code](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/Telecom%20Customer%20Churn%20Prediction%20Code.R) and [Final report](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/Customer%20Churn%20Prediction%20Report.pdf) available
* Technology: **R** (dplyr, caret, PRROC, rpart, rpart.plot)

## [Stock and Portfolio Analysis](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Stock-and-Portfolio-Analysis-and-Prediction) <a name="stock-and-portfolio-analysis"></a>

I did these projects for my 'Programming for Finance' course during my undergraduate.

### [Stock Analysis for Burshane Private Limited (BPL)](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Stock-and-Portfolio-Analysis-and-Prediction/tree/main/Project%201) <a name="stock-analysis-for-burshane-private-limited-bpl"></a>

* Real-life stock data used through Yahoo Finance library
* Programming language used: Python
* Important tech concepts used: Prophet (time series forecasting), RollingOLS (Rolling Regression), Backtesting
  1. Prophet is used for time series forecasting of stock prices
  2. RollingOLS is used to calculate beta in a rolling window for Cost of Capital calculation
  3. Backtesting is used to test strategies on historical data
* [Code](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Stock-and-Portfolio-Analysis-and-Prediction/tree/main/Project%201) and [Final report](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Stock-and-Portfolio-Analysis-and-Prediction/blob/main/Project%201/Project%201%20-%20Javeria%20Malik%20-%20BPL.pdf) available
* Technology: **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, talib, prophet, backtesting, psx, numpy)

### [Portfolio Risk Analysis and Optimization for PKGS, PPP, BPL](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Stock-and-Portfolio-Analysis-and-Prediction/tree/main/Project%202) <a name="portfolio-risk-analysis-and-optimization-for-pkgs-ppp-bpl"></a>

* Important concepts used: Historical VaR, Model-Building VaR, Monte-Carlo VaR, Copulas
  1. Historical VaR is used for calculating Value at Risk using historical stock price data
  2. Model-Building VaR is used for calculating Value at Risk using the parametric approach and variance-covariance matrix
  3. Monte-Carlo VaR is used for calculating Value at Risk using simulations
  4. Copulas are used for modeling dependencies between different stocks in the portfolio
* [Code](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Stock-and-Portfolio-Analysis-and-Prediction/tree/main/Project%202) and [Final report](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Stock-and-Portfolio-Analysis-and-Prediction/blob/main/Project%202/Project%202%20-%20Portfolio%20Analysis%20-%20Report.pdf) available

## [Pokemon Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Pokedex-EDA) <a name="pokedex-eda-analysis"></a>

I did this project as part of my exploratory data analysis (EDA) practice to analyze the attributes of Pokémon from a dataset.

* Dataset: [Pokedex Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hamzacyberpatcher/data-of-1010-pokemons)
* Explored Pokémon statistics including attack, defense, and total scores by types, generations, and ranks
* Created visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and box plots to analyze patterns in Pokémon stats
* Analyzed legendary, mythical, and ordinary Pokémon to find insights about their strengths and characteristics
* Provided insights and recommendations on which Pokémon to start with and which ones to catch for players of the game
* [Code and Analysis](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Pokedex-EDA/blob/main/Pokedex_EDA.ipynb) available
* Technology: **Python** (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy)

## [Maven Movies Analysis-SQL](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Maven-Movies-Analysis-SQL) <a name="maven-movies-analysis-sql"></a>

* Implemented SQL queries with aggregate functions, CASE statements, JOIN operations, and UNION to extract and merge comprehensive relational database insights.
* Important Concepts Used: Exploratory Data Analysis of a movie database
  1. Basic SQL Operations: SELECT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
  2. Data Aggregation: Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX)
  3. Data Filtering and Sorting: HAVING, CASE statements
  4. Data Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, multi-condition joins
  5. Data Manipulation: UNION operations
* Technology: **SQL**
