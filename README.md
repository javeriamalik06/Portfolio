# Javeria Malik - Data Analysis/Science Portfolio

# [Telecom Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction)
I did this project for my 'Analytical Approach in Marketing Decisions' course during my undergraduate.
* Data was taken from Kaggle
* Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression and Decision Trees
* Logistic Regression was used to predict the churn and profitability
* Decision trees was used to identify customer segments and the strategies that could be used to maximise the satisfaction from each segment
* Code and Final report available
* Technology: **R**: caret, PRROC, rpart, rpart.plot
# [Stock and Portfolio Analysis](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Stock-and-Portfolio-Analysis-and-Prediction)
I did these projects for my 'Programming for Finance' course during my undergraduate.
* Real-life stock data used through Yahoo Finance library
* Programming language used: Python
  ## [Stock Analysis for Burshane Private Limited (BPL)](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Stock-and-Portfolio-Analysis-and-Prediction/tree/main/Project%201)
* Important tech concepts used: Prophet(time series forecasting), RollingOLS(Rolling Regression), Backtesting
  1. Prophet is used for time series forecasting of stock prices
  2. RollingOLS is used to calculate beta in a rolling window for Cost of Capital calculation
  3. Backtesting is used to test the strategies on historical data
* Code and Final report available
* Technology: **Python**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, talib, prophet, backtesting, psx, numpy
  ## Project 2
  * Important concepts used: Historical VaR, Model-Building VaR, Monte-Carlo VaR, Copulas
  1. Historical VaR is used for calculating Value at Risk using historical stock price data
  2. Model-Building VaR is used for calculating Value at Risk using the parametric approach and variance-covariance matrix
  3. Monte-Carlo VaR is used for calculating Value at Risk using simulations
  4. Copulas are used for modeling dependencies between different stocks in the portfolio
* Code and Final report available
* Technology: **Python**: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statsmodels, copulae, riskfolio, psx, yfinance
# [Maven Movies Analysis-SQL](https://github.com/javeriamalik06/Maven-Movies-Analysis-SQL)
*Technology: **SQL**
